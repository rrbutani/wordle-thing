# `wordle-thing`

silly program that tries to guess your usual first guess from a tweet thread

---

Call with: `cargo run -- <id of a thread thread>`.

For [example](https://twitter.com/KZXcellent/status/1481194168605097987): `cargo run -- 1481194168605097987`:
```bash
[222] â¬›ðŸŸ¨â¬›â¬›ðŸŸ¨ (mount)
[221] â¬›â¬›â¬›â¬›â¬› (whack)
[220] ðŸŸ©â¬›â¬›ðŸŸ¨â¬› (sugar)
[219] â¬›â¬›â¬›â¬›ðŸŸ¨ (knoll)
[218] â¬›â¬›â¬›ðŸŸ¨â¬› (crimp)
[217] â¬›â¬›ðŸŸ¨â¬›ðŸŸ¨ (wince)
[216] â¬›â¬›â¬›ðŸŸ¨â¬› (prick)
Using regex: `[s][t][e][r][n]`.

Is your first guess.. stern?
